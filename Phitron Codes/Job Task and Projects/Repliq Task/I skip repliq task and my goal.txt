Today is saturday, 260823, 07.00 am. 
I am skipping the repliq task. I am reassigning my priorities. 
I need to learn the drf properly. I am upskilling. 
I have taken 4 months roadmap. 

I have two possibilities. 

Path one : 
Spet, Oct, Mid Nov - upskill.
Later Nov to Dec - actively job apply. 

Path two : 
If I get selected for outreachy program, in the initial phace (result is in 02th oct, 2023) 
then work for outreachy by contributing to selected projects. 
If I then get selected (result in 20 Nov, 2023) then work as intern in outreachy. 

But, the whole sept is no responsibilities of outreachy - so build relevant skills in this month. 
If selected for outreachy, then work the Oct in favour of outreachy. 

If not selected in the initial application, then keep upscaling as per my path one commitment. 

Hope to get the better, May Allah bless us all, amin.
