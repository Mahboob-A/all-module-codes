Mod: 21-3: Tabulation and Memoization in Code 


# Memoization-Method (recursive)
======================

fun(a, b, c ... n)      -> state 
{
        step 01: 
                1. handle base cases 
        
        step 02: 
                2. if current state is already solved, then return the result 
        
        step 03: 
                3. calculate the resutl from the smaller sub-problems. 

}

#Tabulation-Method (iterative)
===================

int main()
{
        step 01: 
                1. handle base cases 
        
        step 02: 
                2. loop through the states 
                        2.1. and calculate the answer from the smaller sub-problems
