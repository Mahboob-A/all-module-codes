1.  can not filter based on date in transaction report => the error is TypeError at /transactions/report/

'coroutine' object is not subscriptable


2. After loggin in, the path should be home path with the navbar but the paht goes to to incorrect path : 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/profile/     

# FIXES : 

2. This is fixed as the auth uses functionalities from django.contrib.auth and as the default 
login urlconf is 'accounts/profile'
changed the default to home using LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/' in settings.py
